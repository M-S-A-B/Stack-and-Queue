Title:Number system

Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory:
**Stack:**
A stack is an abstract data structure that contains a collection of elements. Stack implements the LIFO mechanism i.e. the element that is pushed at the end is popped out first. Some of the principle operations in the stack are −

Push - This adds a data value to the top of the stack.

Pop - This removes the data value on top of the stack

Peek - This returns the top data value of the stack

**Queue:**

A queue is an abstract data structure that contains a collection of elements. Queue implements the FIFO mechanism i.e., the element that is inserted first is also deleted first. In other words, the least recently added element is removed first in a queue.

In software terms, the queue can be viewed as a set or collection of elements as shown below. The elements are arranged linearly.

We have two ends i.e. “front” and “rear” of the queue. When the queue is empty, then both the pointers are set to -1.

The “rear” end pointer is the place from where the elements are inserted in the queue. The operation of adding /inserting elements in the queue is called “enqueue”.

The “front” end pointer is the place from where the elements are removed from the queue. The operation to remove/delete elements from the queue is called “dequeue”.

When the rear pointer value is size-1, then we say that the queue is full. When the front is null, then the queue is empty.
